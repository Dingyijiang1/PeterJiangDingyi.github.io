# üí¨About me

Hi, I am Dingyi Jiang. Presently, I am an Artificial Intelligence major bachelor and will graduate in 2024 summer, where I am in <a href='http://cic.tju.edu.cn/english/home.htm'>the College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University</a>(Â§©Ê¥•Â§ßÂ≠¶Êô∫ËÉΩ‰∏éËÆ°ÁÆóÂ≠¶ÈÉ®). I have several AI-related projects and internships. Notably, I participated in an exchange program during 2023 at <a href='https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/'>the Department of Computer Science and Technology at HKUST</a>(È¶ôÊ∏ØÁßëÊäÄÂ§ßÂ≠¶ËÆ°ÁÆóÊú∫ÁßëÂ≠¶‰∏éÊäÄÊúØÂ≠¶Èô¢).

<a href='https://peterjiangdingyi.github.io/transcripts.github.io/main.html'>Click Here to Visit My Overall GPA.</a>

Because my first two years at Tianjin University were studying applied chemistry and after that, I changed major, so my transcripts contain lots of non-computer-related courses. Therefore, I put my core GPA which just contains computer-related courses together here.

- *2022.04 - 2023.05* Acted as Leader in Municipal College Students Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training ProgramÔºå *Intelligent Visualization of the Attributes of the Global Burden of Disease*, supervised by Professor <a href='http://geoanalytics.tju.edu.cn/jieli'>Jie Li</a> and <a href='https://www.ai.pku.edu.cn/info/1140/2160.htm'>Dr. Liang Zhou</a>.
  
  In this project, We conducted a Graph Neural Network to analyze the similarity between diseases worldwide.
  1. By utilizing meta-path-related GNN to identify the correlation between diseases, converting the heterogeneous graph into an isomorphic graph, and then applying deepwalk to the isomorphic graph to obtain the representation of t-SNE dimensionality reduction visualization, a verification function can be provided.
  2. Research visualization result:

    4. The edges of the project:
         (1) By using all kinds of meta-path, we can construct any arbitrary pattern to analyze topological information on the burden of diseases.
         (2) By using GNN, we can utilize the homogeneous graph derived from metapath to form embeddings to accurately analyze the similarity of diseases.

  1. In collaboration with <a href='http://www.farwide-electric.com/'>Shenzhen farwide-electric Co., Ltd (Ê∑±Âú≥ÂºòËøúÁîµÊ∞îÊúâÈôêÂÖ¨Âè∏)</a>, a research project has been undertaken to explore the potential of Al in the field of hazardous fire protection, This project seeks to utilize Al technology to detect high voltage in order to preemptively control fires
  2. In this undertaking, l was responsible for the comprehensive upkeep of the system which encompasses an Al algorithm (such as SVM) and a Flask web framework, This necessitates a thorough understanding of the intricate interplay between the two components as well as the ability to identify and rectify any issues that may arise. Furthermore, I must guarantee its optimal performance (accuracy uplifted from 85% to 90%).
     
- *2023.04 - 2023.05* HKUST COMP 4901v Final Project, *Transformer-based Semantic Segmentation on 3D Point Clouds for Autonomous Driving*, supervised by Professor <a href='https://www.danxurgb.net/'> Dan XU</a>, and groupmates Martin R. Inauen, Mikhail Tsirlin.
  1. We reproduced the effort of the paper <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09164'> Point Transformer</a> and delved into the potential of self-attention networks for self-driven related 3D point cloud processing. Our study involves understanding and using self-attention layers specifically for point clouds, which serve as fundamental building blocks for constructing self-attention networks deployed in semantic scene segmentation.
