# üí¨Why I want to apply for AI Ph.D.

Now I am applying for an AI-related Ph.D. My research interests lie within the realm of Artificial Intelligence (AI), such as NLP, GAN, AIGC, as well as AI fairness and ethic. I truly believe that as time progresses, people will increasingly embrace the incredible general AI, which has the potential to reshape our world in profound ways.

With this strong conviction in mind, I feel pursuing a Ph.D. degree is crucial to gain deeper insights into the field. During the doctoral program, I will have the opportunity to engage in in-depth research, contributing to the ever-evolving AI landscape and making meaningful contributions to the field.

What's more, I have 2 AI-related research experiences and 2 AI-related Internships. I am confident that my past experiences in AI-related endeavors and my unwavering motivation will enable me to immerse myself fully in AI research.

Therefore, I am eager to embark on the journey of obtaining a Ph.D. in AI, where I can passionately delve into the intricacies of the field. I envision a future where AI is used ethically and responsibly, and I hope to play a significant role in shaping this positive outcome through my contributions to the field of Artificial Intelligence.

# üìù What Rescearchs I participated in 

- *2022.04 - 2023.05* Leader in Municipal College Students Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training ProgramÔºå *Intelligent Visualization of the Attributes of the Global Burden of Disease*, with Professor <a href='http://geoanalytics.tju.edu.cn/jieli'>Jie Li</a>.
  In this project, We conduct GNN to analyze the similarity of diseases worldwide.
  1. By utilizing meta-path-related GNN to identify the correlation between diseases, converting the heterogeneous graph into an isomorphic graph, and then applying deepwalk to the isomorphic graph to obtain the representation of t-SNEdimensionality reduction visualization, a verification function can be provided.
  2. Research visualization result:

- *2022.04 - 2023.05* Researcher in Intelligent Fire Control Project, with Professor <a href='http://cic.tju.edu.cn/faculty/yangliu/index.html'>Liu Yang</a>.
  1. In collaboration with Shenzhen Hong Yuan Co., Ltd, a research project has been undertaken to explore the potential of Al in the field of hazardous fire protection, This project seeks to utilize Al to detect high voltage in order to preemptively control fires
  2. In this undertaking, l am responsible for the comprehensive upkeep of the system which encompasses an Al algorithm and a Flask web framework, This necessitates a thorough understanding of the intricate interplay between the two components as well as the ability to identify and rectify any issues that may arise. FurthermoreI must guarantee its optimal performance (accuracy uplifted from 85% to 90%).
- *2023.04 - 2023.05* HKUST COMP 4901v Final Project, *Transformer-based Semantic Segmentation on 3D Point Clouds for Autonomous Driving*, with Professor <a href='https://www.danxurgb.net/'> Dan XU</a>, and groupmates Martin R. Inauen, Mikhail Tsirlin.
  We reproduced the effort of the paper <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09164'> Point Transformer</a> and delve into the potential of self-attention networks for self-driven related 3D point cloud processing. Our study involves understanding and using self-attention layers specifically for point clouds, which serve as fundamental building blocks for constructing self-attention networks deployed in semantic scene segmentation.
