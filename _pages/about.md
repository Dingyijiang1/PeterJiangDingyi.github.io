<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Presently, I am pursuing my undergraduate studies at Tianjin University, where I am enrolled in <a href='http://cic.tju.edu.cn/english/home.htm'>the College of Intelligence and Computing(天津大学智能与计算学部)</a>. I anticipate completing my Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence by June 2024. Notably, I had the privilege of participating in an academic exchange program during my third year at <a href='https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/'>the Department of Computer Science and Technology at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology(HKUST, 香港科技大学计算机科学与技术学院)</a>.

My interest research area encompasses the domain of AI, including NLP, GAN, CV, and related areas. During my undergraduate studies in Artificial Intelligence at Tianjin University and HKUST, I embarked on a journey of academic exploration and practical application. Through coursework, research projects, and collaborations, I have acquired significant knowledge in the design, implementation, and optimization of Deep Neural Networks. I have effectively employed these techniques to address intricate problems in Graph Neural Networks (GNN), Generative Artificial Intelligence, and Computer Vision, which have further deepened my fascination for these domains.
